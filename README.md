# Facial Emotion Recognition Project <br>
# Overview <br>
This repository contains the code and resources for a Facial Emotion Recognition project. <br>
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can recognize facial expressions and predict the corresponding emotions. <br>
The project includes data collection, preprocessing, model development, and a web-based user interface for real-time emotion recognition. <br>

# Motivation <br>
Understanding human emotions from facial expressions is crucial in various applications, including user experience design, human-computer interaction, and mental health monitoring. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to build a Facial Emotion Recognition system that can be applied in real-world scenarios. <br>
 
## Key Features <br>
Data Collection: Gathered diverse datasets of facial images labeled with corresponding emotions. <br>
Model Development: Built and trained a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras for accurate emotion recognition. <br>
User Interface: Developed a web-based user interface using Flask to allow users to interact with the model and input images for emotion recognition. <br>
Real-time Processing: Optimized the model for real-time processing, making it suitable for applications that require quick responses. <br>
